"The password for Century10 is the 161st word within the file on the desktop."

This one was kind of interesting, and I found a couple ways to get the desired results, both checking against whitespace between words:

PS C:\users\century9\desktop> (Get-Content .\Word_File.txt) -split '\s+' | select-object -index 160
**pierid**
PS C:\users\century9\desktop> ((Get-Content '.\Word_File.txt').split(' '))[160]
**pierid**
PS C:\users\century9\desktop>

seems both work, but the second one _can_ be affected by double spaces and skew the results a bit.

century10:pierid
